# NoRandomApparelOnIdeoEdit
Commissioned RimWorld mod to optimize Ideology creation on large mod lists

Generating required Ideology apparel for roles takes a lot of time on large modlists with high amount of new apparel items, which causes the game to freeze on each modification of the ideology structure and/or memes.

This mod bypass that by simply disabling automatic apparel generation for these roles.
