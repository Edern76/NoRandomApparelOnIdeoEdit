# NoRandomApparelOnIdeoEdit

## Description
Simple commissioned RimWorld mod to optimize Ideology creation on large mod lists

Generating required Ideology apparel for roles takes a lot of time on large modlists with high amount of new apparel items, which causes the game to freeze on each modification of the ideology structure and/or memes.

This mod bypasses that by simply disabling automatic apparel generation for these roles.

## Requirements

Requires **Harmony** and obviously the Ideology DLC

## Compatibility

Put this toward the top of your load order, right under framework/library mods such as HugsLib/JecsTools/Vanilla Framework Expanded (if you have none of such mods, place it under the official DLCs).

Should be compatible with about anything except things that explicitly modify how role required apparel is generated. Mods that simply add new role apparel options should be fine however.
